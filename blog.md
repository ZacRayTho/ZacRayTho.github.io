# My answers 

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

 Not what I expected because I was not aware of how important Github and Git were. I am enjoying it though and the slow transition into everything and can't wait to **ramp** it up.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

 I'm excited about learning more code-centric stuff like javascript, or backend development. 

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

 I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a rubik's cube or flip a butterfly knife. But some interests don't stick so when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp, I was unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course and did other various online courses for probably 6 months leading up to applying for the bootcamp.

 ## 2-6-23 Onboarding Sprint 2
 
 ### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

     They play an important part,they are what the user will see and will affect the whole user experience. No one wants to go a site that looks like its
     been around since the dawn of computers.    

 ### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

    I understand the importance of pseudocoding, its a high level interpretation of code that anyone should be able to read and understand. 
    Its suppose to lay out the foundation for all the coding in the rest of the project, and just make the coding easier in general. I would say
    currently I'm not very good at pseudocode but confident i will be by the end of the course.
    
### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

    Google was my best friend. The help channel even though I didn't post in it seeing other peoples having similar problems made me feel like I wasn't 
    totally off the path that was laid out. Also seeing other peoples projects was nice too to see how much progress everyone was making.
    
### What Hindered your progress during Onboarding?

    Mostly myself, I struggled to pay attention near the end of the day. Especially if I was having trouble with a problem, I couldn't stay focused until I 
    figured it out and than it was like a snowball effect when I started making progress.
    
### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding? 

    I just had to push myself, or take 15 minutes breaks to hopefully break up the constant screen time and give my brain a rest from all the logic solving.
