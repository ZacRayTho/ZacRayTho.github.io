# My answers 

## Week 1
## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

 Not what I expected because I was not aware of how important Github and Git were. I am enjoying it though and the slow transition into everything and can't wait to **ramp** it up.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

 I'm excited about learning more code-centric stuff like javascript, or backend development. 

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

 I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a rubik's cube or flip a butterfly knife. But some interests don't stick so when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp, I was unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course and did other various online courses for probably 6 months leading up to applying for the bootcamp.

## Week 2
 ## 2-6-23 Onboarding Sprint 2
 
 ### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

     They play an important part,they are what the user will see and will affect the whole user experience.  
     No one wants to go a site that looks like its been around since the dawn of computers.    

 ### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

    I understand the importance of pseudocoding, its a high level interpretation of code that anyone should  
    be able to read and understand. Its suppose to lay out the foundation for all the coding in the rest of   
    the project, and just make the coding easier in general. I would say currently I'm not very good at pseudocode  
    but confident i will be by the end of the course.
    
### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

    Google was my best friend. The help channel even though I didn't post in it seeing other peoples having  
    similar problems made me feel like I wasn't totally off the path that was laid out. Also seeing other   
    peoples projects was nice too to see how much progress everyone was making.
    
### What Hindered your progress during Onboarding?

    Mostly myself, I struggled to pay attention near the end of the day. Especially if I was having trouble   
    with a problem, I couldn't stay focused until I figured it out and than it was like a snowball effect when  
    I started making progress.
    
### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding? 

    I just had to push myself, or take 15 minutes breaks to hopefully break up the constant screen time and   
    give my brain a rest from all the logic solving.

## Week 3 
## 2-13-23 Sprint 1 HTML/CSS/JS/STATE

### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

    Probably styling I can get the grids to lay out but getting the things inside the containers to center 
    or position how I want without a bunch of css and bootstrap on everything cluttering the html is difficult. 

### What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript,Bootstrap, Atomic Design?

    I think i'd like to to learn more about bootstrap because I still struggle alot with centering things without 
    having to cover every container with the same class. 

### What is your "Why" ?
 
    I worked at walmart for 4 years and didn't want to just work retail all my life,and management definetly isn't for me.
    I always wanted to have a more important job and make more money and tried my hand at several things but either didn't 
    care for them or the pay at the end of the road wasn't worth it to me. Of course I also want to provide for my family 
    aswell, and be able to take care of them. But at the moment my girlfriend lives with her sister and I roommate with
    my mother so I'd say its mostly my want to better myself.
    
## Week 4
## 2-20-23 Sprint 2 VanillaJS

### What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

    You can't have everything right when you want it ,and you can't always expect to get back the results you want.   
    thats how APIs work,you have to program accordingly to so as not to hinder the User experience waiting on results of an API.   
    and you have to defensively program incase the API doesn't return what you expected.

### What does it mean to develop good code?

    It means to develop code that gets the job done in the most simple way without hindering performance or user experience.
    it means good documentation/pseudocode to back up your code so its easier understanding it after a week or in the
    case that someone else has to interact with it.

### What does it mean to be a good developer?

    to practice good coding practices and understand the end goal thoroughly before even beginning the code.

### What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

    typing and repeating themselves,so they made functions and thousands of libraries that are open source and
    free to use for anyone who wants them.

## Week 5
## 2-27-23 Sprint 3 Technical Article

### What is pseudocode and how does it help programming?

    The most basic definition of pseudocode to me, is a high level "coding language". A more in depth definition  
    would be, pseudocode is every step that you want the computer to go through,broken down into the most basic   
    logic, until you have identified everything needed for every step. Its writing out all possible functions you  
    may need, and all variables that function may need or a variable that every function in the program needs access  
    to. There are lots of ways to add to your pseudocode, so to help you think more in depth about everything.    

    One of the first things we learned about was atomic design and how to identify parts of a webpage/wireframe and  
    break them down into atoms, molecules, and organisms. We recently learned about MoSCoW which stands for   
    "Must Have,Should Have,Could Have, and Won't Have". While I wouldn't say its pseudocode directly, it can  
    help keep your direction while pseudocoding so you don't get hung up on a detail that you could have and   
    focus more on what you must have. Theres also the "User Journey" which describes the process the user go   
    through when operating the app/website.     

    Pseudocode helps programmers in the first half of the development process so you can work through the logic  
    only without having to worry about syntax of the coding language. It also is more readable for a human so   
    that a development team doesn't have to question each other about what they mean by some form of code. Best   
    of all pseudocode can be translated into any programming language you want easily, given that you know that   
    languages syntax already.

## Week 6
## 3-3-23 Sprint 4 React Intro

### Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

    I think JavaScript Libraries at first are hard to use because they introduce new things and new ways to do   
    things that were previously impossible. Having one week with React under my belt, I would say they aren't   
    really hard to use. Its still Javascript, just with a some new syntax and built in functions  

### What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

    In my self studies, I started learning about Flask, which seems very similar to React with using a single html  
    "boilerplate"/skeleton. I don't think we go over that in this bootcamp but I believe Django will be a better   
    framework. I think Django is a more developed framework and Flask is meant to be more lightweight. Regardless   
    i'm excited to learn more about React and Django when we get there.  

### Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

    As I researched emerging Javascript tools, React seems to be the newest and most popular JavaScript tool out  
    right now. I would like to learn about Angular as its a framework instead of library. From what i've read   
    libraries are more in control of the workflow and Angular may get harder to debug as the project grows due to   
    it changing the view and model based on each other. I still would think it would be fun and give me a different   
    angle into web development. 

## Week 7
## 3-10-23 Sprint 5 React 2.0

### What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?

    I've learned that CLI's are the original way people had to operate computers,before GUIs and mouses took over.    
    I think to the uninformed they are, because you don't know what to say, what the computer can understand or what   
    it expects from you. I would say after some time with them (learning Git commands and navigating files with just    
    CLI), they aren't scary and they actually improve speed, because as you learn more commands and get more familiar     
    with them, you have to take your hands away from the keyboard less. Navigating GUIs are inherently slower but     
    more user friendly.

### If your were to build a CLI, what would it do?

    If I were to build a CLI, it would probably just have more simple shortcuts for common things, like a shorthand that  
    `git add .` `git commit` and `git push`. because each of those individually takes time. Or maybe add a command that  
    starts an old text-adventure based RPG for some cognitive breaks.

### List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code

    Creating a big website with multiple pages, like wikipedia. Having seperate pages for each files also contains a ton of  
    copy and pasted code which if 2 pages shared info retaining to would mean more hard code that would need to be found   
    and then changed. Styling would also be way more involved without a framework like bootstrap, considering how deep CSS   
    itself is, just trying to find something that Bootstrap doesn't make easy to use is a involved process.

## Week 8
## 3-10-23 Sprint 6 Halfway!

### Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past?   
What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?

    My biggest hurdle probably was stepping outside of VanillaJS, since thats where most of my prior experience was, I   
    didn't even think about single page applications being a thing prior to React's introduction. I just assumed  
    that every webpage had its own HTML file that a bunch a stuff of copied and pasted to each time. My next   
    hurdle I think will be just back-end in general with no visuals to look at for immediate feedback on if something  
    is working or not. I also definetly know the final project will be the biggest hurdle at the end of the road, as well  
    as all the interviews I'll probably have to do before landing a career.

### Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the  
same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

    A safe bet for a final project would probably be an Ebay/Marketplace or other popular site clone. I don't see   
    anything wrong with my two previous ideas of, a car dealership website , or TCGplayer clone. Although I don't
    know if the car dealership site would use everything I'll learn by the end of the bootcamp, and thats one   
    of the big reasons for the final project, to show off all your new skills and everything you know.

### What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript? 

    I've had a little prior experience with python prior to the bootcamp, since it's what pops up most frequently   
    when you google "what coding language should I learn?". But I mostly just learned syntax and didn't really  
    do any projects myself, mostly watched videos. I know now that video may be a important part of the learning   
    process, but if you never code yourself, it won't stick. It was different from JS because we already knew   
    most of the correct general syntax and functions. Its weird certain methods in JS are their own function   
    in python like len(str) instead of str.len . Hopping into (P)OOP immediately also was different, classes
    are something that I always knew were there but never really messed with. I can't wait to use them more next  
    week and see how often we reuse them in the project.


### What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?

    Theres a lot of similarities between JS and Python, they both have similar functions and abilities, both are  
    pretty capable of the same stuff. Where they differ at is , Python is unable to access the DOM like JS can,   
    and they both have there own syntax rules and formatting.

### If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?

    Starting with python would have also meant starting with the backend, which I think may have been more difficult   
    since the backend is more technical. Moving from Python to Javascript would have also been more difficult since  
    python has much less syntax to remember besides the indentation. I like the Bootcamp's style of starting with  
    something the hard way to get an understanding of whats happening, then introducing something else which makes  
    it easier for us. 

### Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future? 

    Thinking about all the websites I use in a daily basis, I definitely have a better understanding of how they work  
    and even how some databases might be structured. I don't think I would enjoy building a big database and thinking  
    of all the queries necessary to get only a little amount of data back. I understand the importance of databases  
    and SQL, and could probably work in depth with them if needed but its not high on my list of wants.

## Week 9
## Django 

### What are you struggling with the most in the tech stack so far and why?

    I think it's pretty hard to narrow what i'm struggling with the most in the tech stack. Some times I     
    struggle with aligning front end components, other times trying to get the specific data from queries    
     can  be a hassle. Django definitely helps with queries though and sometimes bootstrap cooperates and     
     aligns stuff how I want.


### After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point for you? What was it like connecting front and back end?

    A sticking point for me is keeping up to up date with all the newest libraries and frameworks that are always revolving, and just staying constant on practicing for both ends of the stack. My first jump back into javascript from python after 2 weeks without curly brackets, It was a struggle to say to least to remember the right syntax.

    Connecting the front end to the back was a more simple process then what I thought. I was not aware that APIs were able to take requests from the front end and modify the database, because I have only ever used APIs to read data from. I figured there'd be a whole separate process to send data back until I realized that Axios had methods named after all the CRUD functions.

## Week 10
## Finish Line 1

### Describe Agile Development or a specific ceremony(stand up, retro, sprints)

    Agile development is an approach towards software development, focused more around the customer, than around the initial plans. Agile is named aptly since the whole process it covers is agile in the way that if the   plans change no matter the reason, the development should be able to pivot without nuking and paving the entire project and starting from the ground. Agile methodologies also include communication and collaboration     between multiple teams who are working on separate aspects of the project. This week we solely focused on our MVPs, and besides me updating my portfolio with new stuff I've learned, there was no coding this week.      Definitely was a different week that was slow to start, but it highlights an importance aspect of agile development, the MVP is the a way to obtain the most data for the project with the least effort while providing     something for the customer.    

### Convince someone who does not use frameworks why using a framework is beneficial.

    Frameworks are beneficial because they reduce the amount of code you need to write and in doing so also keep with DRY principles. Theres no need to reinvent the wheel, and sometimes someone has already wrote a thousand plus lines of code and even made classes, methods, and functions to make it easier for you to implement the code into your project without interfering with anything already in it.

## Evercraft Blog

    This Week I've been revisiting the Evercraft project from the bootcamp. The Evercraft project is all about Test-Driven Development (TDD) while building a domain model. This project consist of several iterations, each introducing new features and requirements, I limited myself to only the first two iterations for now. A side product of this project is writing a massive amount of code and learning a lot about the language you are coding it in. I was motivated to redo this project by my desire to sharpen my Python skills. Python is the backend language we started learning at the Awesome Inc U bootcamp and I want to ensure my full stack skills are honed so I can be ready to not only use them on my personal projects but contribute to my future employer.
    
    The TDD process begins with writing failing tests, focusing on small code units, and writing the code to pass the test after. This approach ensures proper feature integration and catches bugs early on. During the project, I encountered some challenges from not approaching the project with a proper object-oriented mindset. In hindsight, I realize the importance of well-defined classes that improve maintainability, and functionality. This was something the instructors had educated us on, and now on my own doing projects I remember why. I will remember the struggles my lack of OOP caused when I tackle my next project! Upon further review of the project during debrief, I realized I did not seek feedback from others earlier in the project, doing so could have provided alternative insights, perspectives, and other solutions. My inclusion of other insights could have happened through clean pseudocode, pairing with a peer, or checking in with my past instructors. Although I am extremely happy with completing this project on my own, identifying and naming these challenges served as important lessons, emphasizing the value of object-oriented design principles and benefits of early collaboration and feedback.
    
    Overall the Evercraft project improved my understanding of object-oriented programming, leveraging Python's features effectively, and applying Test-Driven Development principles. Revisiting the Evercraft project from bootcamp has been a rewarding experience for sharpening my Python skills. I look forward to pushing the boundaries of what I can accomplish and embracing new opportunities for growth.
