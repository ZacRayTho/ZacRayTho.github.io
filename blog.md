# My answers

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

1. Not what I expected because I was not aware of how important Github and Git were. I am enjoying it though and the slow transition into everything and can't wait to **ramp** it up.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

1. I'm excited about learning more code-centric stuff like javascript, or backend development. 

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

1. I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a rubik's cube or flip a butterfly knife. But some interests don't stick so when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp, I was unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course and did other various online courses for probably 6 months leading up to applying for the bootcamp.
