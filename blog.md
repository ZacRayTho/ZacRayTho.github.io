# My answers 

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

 Not what I expected because I was not aware of how important Github and Git were. I am enjoying it though and the slow transition into everything and can't wait to **ramp** it up.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

 I'm excited about learning more code-centric stuff like javascript, or backend development. 

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

 I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a rubik's cube or flip a butterfly knife. But some interests don't stick so when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp, I was unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course and did other various online courses for probably 6 months leading up to applying for the bootcamp.

 ## 2-6-23 Onboarding Sprint 2
 
 ### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

     They play an important part,they are what the user will see and will affect the whole user experience.  
     No one wants to go a site that looks like its been around since the dawn of computers.    

 ### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

    I understand the importance of pseudocoding, its a high level interpretation of code that anyone should  
    be able to read and understand. Its suppose to lay out the foundation for all the coding in the rest of   
    the project, and just make the coding easier in general. I would say currently I'm not very good at pseudocode  
    but confident i will be by the end of the course.
    
### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

    Google was my best friend. The help channel even though I didn't post in it seeing other peoples having  
    similar problems made me feel like I wasn't totally off the path that was laid out. Also seeing other   
    peoples projects was nice too to see how much progress everyone was making.
    
### What Hindered your progress during Onboarding?

    Mostly myself, I struggled to pay attention near the end of the day. Especially if I was having trouble   
    with a problem, I couldn't stay focused until I figured it out and than it was like a snowball effect when  
    I started making progress.
    
### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding? 

    I just had to push myself, or take 15 minutes breaks to hopefully break up the constant screen time and   
    give my brain a rest from all the logic solving.
   
## 2-10-23 Sprint 1 HTML/CSS/JS/STATE

### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

    Probably styling I can get the grids to lay out but getting the things inside the containers to center 
    or position how I want without a bunch of css and bootstrap on everything cluttering the html is difficult. 

### What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript,Bootstrap, Atomic Design?

    I think i'd like to to learn more about bootstrap because I still struggle alot with centering things without 
    having to cover every container with the same class. 

### What is your "Why" ?
 
    I worked at walmart for 4 years and didn't want to just work retail all my life,and management definetly isn't for me.
    I always wanted to have a more important job and make more money and tried my hand at several things but either didn't 
    care for them or the pay at the end of the road wasn't worth it to me. Of course I also want to provide for my family 
    aswell, and be able to take care of them. But at the moment my girlfriend lives with her sister and I roommate with
    my mother so I'd say its mostly my want to better myself.
    
    
## 2-10-23 Sprint 1 VanillaJS

### What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

    You can't have everything right when you want it ,and you can't always expect to get back the results you want.   
    thats how APIs work,you have to program accordingly to so as not to hinder the User experience waiting on results of an API.   
    and you have to defensively program incase the API doesn't return what you expected.

### What does it mean to develop good code?

    It means to develop code that gets the job done in the most simple way without hindering performance or user experience.
    it means good documentation/pseudocode to back up your code so its easier understanding it after a week or in the
    case that someone else has to interact with it.

### What does it mean to be a good developer?

    to practice good coding practices and understand the end goal thoroughly before even beginning the code.

### What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

    typing and repeating themselves,so they made functions and thousands of libraries that are open source and
    free to use for anyone who wants them.
