      Week one wasn't what I expected, its been slower and not as code oriented
      as I would think. Although I admit, I didn't even know what a version
      control system was, but after git's introduction I can absolutely
      understand the importance of it. I would hate to have to manual revert a
      big chunk of code after I found out it was buggy or unusable. I also
      appreciate the slow intro into everything instead of jumping off on the
      deep end.

      I'm eager to learn more about coding, and just learn in general. I think
      learning is some of the most fun possible with the right subject, teacher,
      and environment. I would say that this bootcamp has all of that and more.
      Personally I can't wait to learn about all the different languages we're
      gonna use and about their ins and outs, and why some are better at certain
      tasks more than others.

      I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a
      rubik's cube or flip a butterfly knife. But some interests don't stick so
      when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp, I was
      unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course
      and did other various online courses for probably 6 months leading up to
      applying for the bootcamp.
