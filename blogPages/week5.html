                The most basic definition of pseudocode to me, is a high level "coding language". A more in depth
                definition would be, pseudocode is every step that you want the computer to go through,broken down into
                the most basic logic, until you have identified everything needed for every step. Its writing out all
                possible functions you may need, and all variables that function may need or a variable that every
                function in the program needs access to. There are lots of ways to add to your pseudocode, so to help
                you think more in depth about everything.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the first things we learned about was atomic design and how to identify parts of a
                webpage/wireframe and break them down into atoms, molecules, and organisms. We recently learned about
                MoSCoW which stands for "Must Have,Should Have,Could Have, and Won't Have". While I wouldn't say its
                pseudocode directly, it can help keep your direction while pseudocoding so you don't get hung up on a
                detail that you could have and focus more on what you must have. Theres also the "User Journey" which
                describes the process the user go through when operating the app/website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pseudocode helps programmers in the first half of the development process so you can work through the
                logic only without having to worry about syntax of the coding language. It also is more readable for a
                human so that a development team doesn't have to question each other about what they mean by some form
                of code. Best of all pseudocode can be translated into any programming language you want easily, given
                that you know that languages syntax already.
