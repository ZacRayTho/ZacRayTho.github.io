                Bootstrap Has way more classes than i know what to do with , but oddly still is very limiting sometimes,
                so figuring out when its better to use bootstrap or normal CSS will help me a lot in the future.
                Bootstraps "justify-content-center" and "justify-content-center" are the most important for aligning
                stuff i'd argue and yet they're the most finicky,sometimes they don't work at all or don't work on
                children elements and I ended up having to repeat the class name on 3 elements within each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Definitely would like to learn more bootstrap, so I can properly use it's classes to the fullest of
                their abilities.
                For Javascript,Nothing specific, but i'd love to learn more about all its function,methods, and
                capabilities so I can be the most proficient in my class.
            </p>

                I worked at walmart for 4 years and didn't want to just work retail all my life,and management
                definitely
                isn't for me. I always wanted to have a more important job and make more money and tried my hand at
                several things but
                either didn't care for them or the pay at the end of the road wasn't worth it to me. Of course I also
                want to provide
                for my family as well, and be able to take care of them. But I'd say its mostly my want to better
                myself.
