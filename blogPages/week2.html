                Week one wasn't what I expected, its been slower and not as code oriented as I would think. Although I
                admit, I didn't even
                know what a version control system was, but after git's introduction I can absolutely understand the
                importance of it.
                I would hate to have to manual revert a big chunk of code after I found out it was buggy or unusable.
                I also appreciate the slow intro into everything instead of jumping off on the deep end.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm eager to learn more about coding, and just learn in general. I think learning is some of the most
                fun possible
                with the right subject, teacher, and environment. I would say that this bootcamp has all of that and
                more.
                Personally I can't wait to learn about all the different languages we're gonna use and about their ins
                and outs, and
                why some are better at certain tasks more than others.</p>

            <p>
                I get sporadic bursts of interests in things, like learning to solve a rubik's cube or flip a butterfly
                knife. But some interests don't stick so when I picked up coding as an interest and found this bootcamp,
                I
                was unsure if I would stick with it. That's why I took the Intro to Web course and did other various
                online
                courses for probably 6 months leading up to applying for the bootcamp.</p>
