                HTML/CSS/JS each play an important role in the whole UX process. While we could write everything in pure
                HTML
                that wouldn't be a pleasant experience and I believe the internet would be a way less interesting place
                if every site looked and behaved exactly the same.
                No one wants to go a site that looks like its been around since the dawn of computers.

                I understand the importance of pseudocoding, its a high level interpretation of code that anyone should
                be able to read and understand. Its suppose to lay out the foundation for all the coding in the rest of
                the project. This helps work through the logic of the problems at hand thoroughly so when we start
                coding, we only need to worry about the syntax which will be super easy as we work more with each
                language.

                Onboarding remotely was definitely different from a traditional classroom setting because there was no
                teacher directly in front of me to ask questions to, and because I was on a computer anyways I felt more
                inclined to google my questions before reaching out in the help channel.
                Even though I didn't use The help channel this week, seeing other peoples having
                similar problems made me feel like I wasn't totally off the path that was laid out. Also seeing other
                peoples projects was nice, because I could get ideas from them and take pieces from their code to fix
                problems in mine.
            </p>

                I think my attention span near the end of the day was my biggest hinderance. Especially if I was having
                trouble
                with a problem, I couldn't stay focused unless I figured it out and then it was like a snowball effect
                when I started making progress.
            </p>
            <p>
               
                When I encountered a challenge that i couldn't solve within 20 minutes, I would take a brief break from
                the screen to rest my brain and my eyes.
                I eventually figured out more debugging tactics like console.log("everything") or the chrome dev tools
                break points.
