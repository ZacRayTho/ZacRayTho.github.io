                 hYou can't have everything right when you want it ,and you can't always expect to get back the results
                you want. thats how APIs work,youave to program accordingly so as not to hinder the User experience by
                waiting on the results of an API. You must program defensively incase the API doesn't return what you
                expected.

                What does it mean to develop good code?
                It means to develop code that gets the job done in the most simple way without hindering performance or
                user experience. Without unnecessary repeating variables or functions(DRY).
                It also means good documentation/pseudocode to back up your code so its easier to understand it after a
                extended period away from it
                or in the case that someone else has to interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does it mean to be a good developer?
                Good developers should code simply but efficiently to get the job done without extra unnecessary code.
                Developers should also think about all possible outcomes of their functions and about user interactions
                that may have a negative outcome on the code/site itself if not used appropriately.
                Most obviously to practice good coding practices and understand the end goal thoroughly before even
                beginning the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
                Definitely typing/repeating themselves,theres so many ways to avoid writing extra code,wether it be a re
                usable function,an external library/framework that pulls in its own functions/methods that wave a wand
                and magically return what you asking for. Not to mention the tons of built in functions/methods that are included in javascript alone.
