                I think JavaScript Libraries at first are hard to use because they introduce new things and new ways to
                do things that were previously impossible. Having one week with React under my belt, I would say they
                aren't really hard to use. Its still Javascript, just with a some new syntax and built in functions</p>
            <p>
                In my self studies, I started learning about Flask, which seems very similar to React with using a
                single
                html "boilerplate"/skeleton. I don't think we go over that in this bootcamp but I believe Django will be
                a better framework. I think Django is a more developed framework and Flask is meant to be more
                lightweight. Regardless i'm excited to learn more about React and Django when we get there.
            </p>

                As I researched emerging Javascript tools, React seems to be the newest and most popular JavaScript tool
                out right now. I would like to learn about Angular as its a framework instead of library. From what i've
                read libraries are more in control of the workflow and Angular may get harder to debug as the project
                grows
                due to it changing the view and model based on each other. I still would think it would be fun and give
                me a
                different angle into web development.
